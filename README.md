# Stock Price Forecasting

Stock Price Forecasting is a challenging task due to the complex and volatile nature of financial markets. This project aims to predict future stock prices using various techniques including ARIMA, SARIMA, and Transformers.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this project contains:

- `Date`: The date of the stock trading.
- `Open`: The opening stock price on the given day.
- `High`: The highest stock price recorded on the given day.
- `Low`: The lowest stock price recorded on the given day.
- `Close`: The closing stock price on the given day.
- `Volume`: The number of shares traded on the given day.

## Techniques Used

1. **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A time-series forecasting model that combines autoregression, differencing, and moving averages.
   
2. **SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: An extension of ARIMA that supports univariate time series data with a seasonal component.
   
3. **Transformers**: Originally designed for natural language processing tasks, Transformer architectures have shown promise in time series forecasting.

## Code Structure

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**:
   - Load the stock price dataset.
   - Normalize or transform the data as required for each technique.
   
2. **Model Creation**:
   - Define and configure the ARIMA, SARIMA, and Transformer models.
   
3. **Training & Forecasting**:
   - Train each model and forecast future stock prices.
   
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   
5. **Visualization**:
   - Plot the real vs. predicted stock prices for each model to visually compare their performances.

## Dependencies

- Python (version 3.x recommended)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- statsmodels (for ARIMA & SARIMA)
- TensorFlow (2.x or above, for Transformers)

## Prerequisites

1. Familiarity with Python programming.
2. Understanding of time-series forecasting concepts.
3. Knowledge of stock market terminologies.

## Setup & Execution

1. **Setup**:
   - Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd path_to_project_directory`
   - Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   
2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Place your dataset in the `data/` directory (or modify the code to point to your dataset's location).

3. **Execution**:
   - Run the main script: `python stock_price_forecasting.py`
   - Analyze the performance metrics and visualizations for each technique.

## Conclusion & Recommendations

While ARIMA and SARIMA are classical time-series forecasting methods, Transformers represent a more recent approach in the machine learning community. It's essential to understand that stock markets are influenced by a multitude of factors, and predicting them with high accuracy consistently is difficult.

Future enhancements can be:
- Incorporating additional data like stock news sentiment, macroeconomic indicators, or technical indicators.
- Exploring ensemble methods or hybrid models.
